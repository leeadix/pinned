## Pinned

Pinned is a geographical-based application that allows users to create pins describing various locations in the Athens area. Whether it's a new restaurant, your favorite gym spot, or a place you don't think gets enough attention, create a pin and share it with the world!

Pinned allows users to have lots of flexibility when creating pins, as pins are not restricted to a certain place/location, meaning you can place a pin wherever you'd like! If you saw a black bear while hiking in the outskirts of Athens, create a pin and show others what you saw!
